title: "Limited Consideration and Physician Gifts"

excerpt: 'Pharmaceutical firms frequently provide physicians with gifts as a routine promotional practice, raising concerns from regulators that gifts could sway physicians towards inappropriate treatment options. I find that gifts are both prevalent and effective in increasing prescriptions, but their impact on patient well-being depends on the mechanisms through which gifts affect prescription behavior. Gifts could potentially distort choice by directly impacting physician preferences for drugs, but they could also improve limited consideration, leading to better patient outcomes. To disentangle these effects, I estimate a structural model of discrete choice under limited consideration in the market for atypical antipsychotics. The model estimates imply that on average physicians consider only 2.4 of the 8 most popular branded drugs, and that gifts primarily impact consideration with a near-zero impact on utility. I find that, across drugs, an additional gift of average value ($24) increases consideration probability by 14.5% on average, leading to a 0.22 standard deviation increase in prescribing. Higher rates of consideration are likely to benefit patients, but firms disproportionately target physicians that are already likely to consider the promoted drug. Counterfactual simulations show that either changes to firm targeting policies or regulation placing annual dollar limits on gifting could lead to more gifts allocated to physicians with low ex-ante rates of consideration. Such changes lead physicians to consider 22-26% more drugs on average, increasing the market shares of most branded drugs. '
